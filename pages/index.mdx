The primary goal of the buddy is to introduce the starter to everyone at the practice group and equip them with the necessary knowledge and skills for their first RfA. To this end, we have sketched a rough outline of three teaching goals for the Buddy to refer to when mentoring the newcomer.

# LEARNING GOALS
1. Introducing the newcomer to the practice group
As the buddy, introduce the newcomer to the practice group. Show them the office and the cafeteria. You can take them to top floor where they can see the view. Do a rondje with the newcomer introduce them to the team members including all the partners. If you are working from home, include the newcomer in Teams calls. Make sure that the newcomer is “well received”.

2. Explaining what is professionally and interpersonally expected from the newcomer
Explain to the newcomer;

- how to handle their work professionally;
- expectations with regards to Billable Hours and innovation (if applicable);
- internal and external correspondence with partners and clients;
- balancing workload; and
- transferring deals.
3. Preparing the newcomer for their first RfA
- Constitutional documents and corporate approvals: Discuss with the newcomer what constitutional and corporate documents are and the relationship between them. Show them where to read and what to look for when drafting corporate approvals.
- Opinion Handbook: Briefly go through the OHB with the newcomer. Explain to the newcomer how we read and use the OHB, what to pay attention and how to navigate.
