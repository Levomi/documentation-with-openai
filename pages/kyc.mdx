# KYC Process

At our law firm, we take the KYC (Know Your Customer) process very seriously in order to ensure the safety and security of our firm and our clients. We have established a comprehensive KYC procedure to be followed when onboarding new clients, which includes the following steps:

## Step 1: Client Identification

The first step in the KYC process is client identification. The KYC team, consisting of John Smith and Emily Brown, is responsible for verifying the identity of the client by collecting personal identification documents such as a passport or driver's license.

## Step 2: Risk Assessment

Once the client's identity has been verified, the KYC team will conduct a risk assessment to determine whether the client poses any potential threat to the firm or its clients. If any red flags are identified during this process, the KYC team will flag the client for further investigation.

## Step 3: Client Acceptance

If the client passes the risk assessment, the KYC team will proceed with client acceptance. This involves collecting additional information about the client such as their source of wealth, business activities, and other relevant details. The KYC team will then make a recommendation to the relevant partner for client acceptance.

## Step 4: Client Decline

In cases where a client poses a potential risk or fails to meet our KYC requirements, the KYC team will recommend that the client be declined. The decision to decline a client ultimately rests with the relevant partner.

## Intop

Our firm uses the Intop KYC software to streamline our client onboarding process. Here is a brief guide on how to use the software:

1. Log in to the Intop software using your assigned credentials.
2. Navigate to the "Client Onboarding" tab and select "New Client".
3. Enter the client's personal information, such as name and address, and upload their identification documents.
4. Select "Submit" to initiate the client identification process.
5. Once the client's identity has been verified, the software will automatically conduct a risk assessment and flag any potential red flags.
6. The KYC team will review the flagged cases and make a recommendation to either proceed with client acceptance or decline the engagement.
7. If the client is accepted, their information will be saved in the Intop software for future reference.

Please note that the Intop KYC software is a complex system and may require additional training to fully utilize its capabilities. If you have any questions or issues with the software, please contact our IT department for assistance.
